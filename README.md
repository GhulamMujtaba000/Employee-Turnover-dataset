# Employee-Turnover-dataset

Introduction
This project presents an implementation of an employee turnover analysis project that is built by using Python’s Scikit-Learn library. In this project, we introduce Random Forest and Decision Tree. We also measure the accuracy of models that are built by using Machine Learning, and we assess directions for further development. Let’s get started.
Step 1
Import libraries
Before going to run this project you need to install these libraries 
from __future__ import print_function
%matplotlib inline
import os
import warnings
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as image
import pandas as pd
plt.style.use("ggplot")
warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_restful import Api, Resource
Step 2
Data Preprocessing
You can download dataset from this link= https://github.com/GhulamMujtaba000/Employee-Turnover-dataset
Each row represents an employee, each column contains employee attributes. 
This data is pretty clean, no missing values.
The data contains 14999 employees and feature

Step 3
Python script
In case you don’t have the libraries then you must download the libraries first then run the script.
You can also download this python file from this link= https://github.com/GhulamMujtaba000/Employee-Turnover-dataset
Video link for more details
In other case if don’t understand the script then I have also created a video.
You can also download this video from this

Now you can run this project
